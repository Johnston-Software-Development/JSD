						'As a Junior Developer, I was involved in the development of the administration site for the eDataNow! mobile application, accessible at https://www.edatanow.com/. This platform is crucial for managing data collected from the mobile app, setting up audit tasks, and presenting data visually through graphs and charts. The frontend was developed using Vue.js, providing a responsive and interactive user interface that allowed administrators to efficiently manage and analyze data. The backend, powered by Ruby on Rails, ensured robust data handling and seamless integration with the mobile application. My responsibilities included implementing features for data collection, developing tools for audit task setup, and creating visual representations of data to facilitate better decision-making. This project provided me with valuable experience in web development and a deeper understanding of integrating frontend and backend technologies.',
